The logic board number and model number correlation is difficult to discern. 50ACCL1 came in an 866W-267 model opener, but the liftmaster website lists the 50ACTWFMC as the replacement logic board.

We can see from the small data set that the communication issue only exists on the two boards which have a 45 series part number.

| Logic Board | Models    | Verified     | Note |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------ | ---- |
| 50ACCL1     | 8366W-267 | Y            | Liftmaster.com lists 50ACTWFMC as the replacement logic board for 8366W-267 |
| 50DCBL5     |           | Y            |
| 50ACTWF     | B550C     | Y            |
| 50ACTWFMC   |           | Untested, should work |
| 45ACBL1     |           | Incompatible |
| 45ACBR5     |           | Incompatible |
